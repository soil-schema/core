# soil

soil is schema language for REST and JSON api and swift / kotlin client code generator.

- Short REST api based schema.
- Small and flexible code generation.
- Write and run api testing scenarios.

Other tools are more good if you want:

- **Speed**: don't use JSON, use [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
- **GraphQL**: soil is not supporting GraphQL.
- **Complex api**: use [Open API Schema](https://www.openapis.org/) and around tools.
